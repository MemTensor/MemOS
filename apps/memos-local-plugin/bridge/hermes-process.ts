/**
 * Hermes foreground process detection.
 *
 * The viewer daemon (`bridge.cts --daemon`) wants to know whether the
 * user has a `hermes chat` or `hermes gateway` session attached to
 * *some* bridge stdio process so it can upgrade its own
 * `"disconnected"` status to `"reconnecting"` instead of leaving the
 * viewer permanently red.
 *
 * Implementation: shell out to `pgrep -f <regex>`. The regex has to
 * cover all three CLI invocation shapes the Hermes CLI supports:
 *
 *   • no flags                    — `hermes chat`
 *   • flags after the subcommand  — `hermes chat --skills memory-routing`
 *   • global flags before it      — `hermes --skills memory-routing chat`
 *   • gateway mode                — `hermes gateway`
 *
 * The third shape is the bug reported in #1915: the previous literal
 * pattern `"hermes chat"` requires the two tokens to be contiguous and
 * therefore misses any invocation with a global flag (`--skills`,
 * `-m`, `--provider`, …) between them.
 *
 * The current pattern is `hermes(?:\s+\S+)*\s+(?:chat|gateway)\b`:
 *
 *   • `hermes`                 — the binary basename.
 *   • `(?:\s+\S+)*`            — any complete argv-style tokens between
 *     the binary and the subcommand.
 *   • `\s+(?:chat|gateway)\b`  — a standalone supported foreground
 *     subcommand token, so it does *not* match `chatter`, `chat-server`,
 *     `--chat-log`, or a flag value like `--profile=chat`.
 *
 * `pgrep -f` on Linux uses glibc's ERE engine, which supports
 * `\s`/`\b` as GNU extensions. JavaScript's `RegExp` supports the same
 * tokens natively, so this module also exports
 * `matchesHermesChatCommandLine()` for unit tests — exercising the
 * pattern as a JS regex is a faithful proxy for the pgrep-side
 * behaviour without requiring a real Hermes binary or a fork of the
 * pgrep process in CI.

 * `false` because the caller only uses the boolean to decide whether
 * to upgrade `"disconnected"` to `"reconnecting"`. Surfacing the

 * of mocking `node:child_process` globally — a Node ESM namespace is
