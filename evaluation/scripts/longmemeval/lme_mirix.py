    # APPROACH (Think step by step):
    1. First, search and check the memories that might contain information related to the question.
    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.
    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.
    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work.
    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.
    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked.
    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references like "yesterday", "last year" but with specific dates.
    8. The answer should be as brief as possible, you should **only state the answer** WITHOUT repeating the question. For example, if asked 'When did Mary go to the store?', you should simply answer 'June 1st'. Do NOT say 'Mary went to the store on June 1st' which is redundant and strictly forbidden. Your answer should be as short as possible.
